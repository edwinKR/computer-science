/*
Scope: The area where a variable has access to some value.

- Global scope
- Local scope: Inside function or block

- Originally, JavaScript only had 'function scope'.
  - Variables only had access to the values defined in the corresponding function or in its parent function.
  - In other words, you have access only to the outer scopes.
