/*
What is functional programming?
- Design pattern
- FP is breaking up your code into like verbs (thinking in terms of the action)
- OOP is like the noun
- FP Advantage: Dealing with pure functions so less side effect. Hence, less error prone. ((i.e. mutate data outside the function or data supplied to the function).
- But in the real world, especially in the web, there are tons of side of effects and pure functions are almost impossible some times.
- JavaScript is multi-paradigm programming language (Object-Oriented Programming and Functional Programming live in harmony)
